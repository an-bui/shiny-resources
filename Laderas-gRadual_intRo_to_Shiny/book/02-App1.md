# App 1: Connecting `ui` and `server`

![*Basic shiny architecture*](img/shiny-architecture.png)

We'll be taking two simple `ggplot2` graphs and turning them into part of an interactive dashboard. The data we're going to use is the `biopics` dataset from the `fivethirtyeight` package. 

## Making a ggplot interactive

The first visualization is a scatterplot visualizing the total `box_office` by `year_release`, colored by `type_of_subject`. For the interactive portion, we're going to color each point by different categories. Notice we use `aes_string()` to map columns to aesthetics. This is important, since we'll be passing `character` arguments to modify this plot later.


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(biopics)

biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(y="box_office", x="year_release", color = "type_of_subject")) +
        geom_point()
```

## Exercise

1. Open the `01_app_basics` folder and open the `app.R` file. This is the file for the Shiny App and we'll modify it.

2. Look at the structure of the code. There are two objects that we define: `ui` and `server`. We make them into an app with the command `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`.

3. Take a look at the `server` code. Notice where our `ggplot2` code is. Both graphs are placed in a `renderPlot()` function, and we give them a place in `output`, so `ui` can "see" it. The scatterplot is named `output$scatter_plot` and the boxplot is named `output$boxoffice_boxplot`. 

4. Take a look at the `ui` code. Where in the code are we displaying `scatter_plot` and `boxoffice_boxplot`? Notice we don't need to refer to `output`. The display function `plotOutput` knows to look in the `output` object.

5. Run the code by clicking the "Run App" button on the top of code window. You can see that we output our graphs in the "main" window.

6. Let's paste in a control. Paste the following code where it says "Add User Interface Element here" in `app.R`. If you run the app again, you should see a control, but it doesn't change the plot.

```
selectInput("color_opts", "Select Category to Color With",
        choices = select_color_options)
```

7. Let's connect the control to the plot. Change the `color` aesthetic to the following:

```
color = input$color_opts
```

8. Now try running the app. Your select box should control what categorical data controls the color of the points. Try it out!

9. Bonus! Let's add in another category option. Where should you add it? Just in case, here are the column names and their data types. You probably shouldn't add `title`, `director`, `subject`, `lead_actor_actress` since they aren't really categories, and they will blow up your `ggplot`s.


```r
glimpse(biopics)
```

```

## More about Inputs and Outputs

As you start to program Shiny apps, you'll need to know the different kinds of inputs and the different kinds of outputs. This is a quick tour of the various types.

### Interactive control tools (from UI to server)

In the above image, the UI uses a function `selectInput()` to allow the user to interactively select the color variable.  In the server, this selected color is called `input$color_var`.

This function `selectInput()` creates a box with choices for the user to select from. There are amny types of selecting tools, including drop down menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, numeric sliders, text input, etc. They all have their own function and they all require an argument `id=` which tells the server what the input is named.

A list of useful control functions can be found below (a more complete list with examples is in [shiny.rstudio.com lesson 3 ](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/)):

function | tool or widget description
---|---
`actionButton` | action button
`checkboxInput` | checkbox input, multiple options allowed
`fileInput` | file upload
`numericInput` | numeric value input
`radioButtons` | radio buttons where only one option is allowed
`selectInput` | a box that a user can type into and choose from choices
`sliderInput` | a slider bar
`textInput` | text/string input


### Display output (from server to UI)

In our above example, the server uses a function `renderPlot()` to send a boxplot image to the UI to display using the function `plotOutput()`.

An example in the server function might be:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {

  output$box_plot <- renderPlot({
    # R code goes here
    ggplot(iris, aes(y=Sepal.Length)) + geom_boxplot()
  })

}
```

Now, we've used `ggplot()` to make our boxplot, and `renderPlot()` assigns this plot to `output$box_plot`. The UI uses 

```r
plotOutput(outputId = "box_plot")
```

which adds the plot stored in `output$box_plot` to the app.

There are many `render*` functions that are reactive functions producing reactive output. Remember, the server is where all the hard work goes. The UI just listens to what the server is giving it.

A list of render and output functions are found in [shiny.rstudio.com lesson 4 ](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson4/)):

render function | creates
---|---
`renderDataTable` |	DataTable
`renderImage`	| images (saved as a link to a source file)
`renderPlot`	| plots
`renderPrint`	| any printed output
`renderTable`	| data frame, matrix, other table like structures
`renderText` |	character strings
`renderUI` |	a Shiny tag object or HTML

Once the result is rendered, the UI takes this output and uses an `*Output` function to produce it in the app:

output function | shows/creates
---|---
`dataTableOutput` |	DataTable
`htmlOutput` |	raw HTML
`imageOutput` |	image
`plotOutput` |	plot
`tableOutput` |	table
`textOutput` |	text
`uiOutput` |	raw HTML
`verbatimTextOutput` |	text

Render functions take one argument (code) wrapped in `({})` such as

```r
renderText({"Hello World"})
```

Output functions take the name of the output object that is the result of a `render*` function.
