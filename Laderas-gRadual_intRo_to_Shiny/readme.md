## A gRadual Introduction to Shiny

Welcome to the workshop! We'll introduce you to the basics behind Shiny, an easy to use web application framework in R. We'll learn the basics by building a data exploration app piece by piece.

01) Getting the basics down
02) What are reactives for?
03) (A) Tooltips and graph interactivity
04) Bringing it all together

## Requirements

You will need a laptop with RStudio installed. Additionally, you will need the following packages installed:

```
install.packages(c("fivethirtyeight", "shiny", "tidyverse"))
```

If you want to use `plotly` in app 04B (which is optional), you'll also need to install it:

```
install.packages("plotly")
```
