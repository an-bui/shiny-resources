## Contributing

We always want your suggestions! If there was a part of the workshop that you found confusing or would like to see covered in more detail, [please let us know in the issue](https://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang/issues/2). We'll give you a contributor's credit! 

If you're a shiny programmer, I appreciate any suggestions for what other shiny programming patterns you found useful.
